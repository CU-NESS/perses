The Pre-EoR Signal Extraction Software (*perses*) package was designed to fit global 21-cm datasets, including various foregrounds, parameters of the instrument, and the cosmological signal itself.

A few papers on how it works:

- Original implementation: `Harker et al. (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.419.1070H>`_.
- *emcee* implementation: `Harker et al. (2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151000271H>`_.

Be warned: this code is still under active development -- use at your own
risk! Correctness of results is not guaranteed.

Getting started
---------------------
To clone a copy and install: ::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ktausch/perses-dev perses
    cd perses
    python setup.py develop

To download a few common sky maps: ::

    python remote.py

It would be in your best interest to set an environment variable which points
to the *perses* install directory, e.g. (in bash) ::

    export PERSES=/users/<yourusername>/perses

*perses* will look in ``$PERSES/input`` for lookup tables of various kinds, e.g., instrumental response, beam pattern, foreground models, etc.

Dependencies
--------------------
You will need:

- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
- `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
- `ares-dev <https://bitbucket.org/mirochaj/ares-dev>`_
- `emcee <http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/>`_

and probably (but optionally), 

- `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_
- `healpy <https://healpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
- `mpi4py <http://mpi4py.scipy.org>`_
- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_
- `ephem <http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/>`_
- `python-progressbar <https://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/>`_
- `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
- `multiprocess <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiprocess>`_

Quick Example
--------------
To make sure everything is working, read in the global sky model and plot it at 80 MHz:

::

    import perses

    mw = perses.foregrounds.Galaxy()
    mw.PlotGSM(80.)

See the documentation for more examples.

Documentation
--------------
To generate the documentation locally, ::

    cd $PERSES/doc
    make html
    open _build/html/index.html
    
This will open the documentation in a browser. For the above to work, you'll
need `sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_, which can be installed
via pip: ::

    pip install sphinx

This depends on `numpydoc <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_, which can also be installed via pip: ::

    pip install numpydoc
